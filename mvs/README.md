# MVS SQL database frontend

This is designed to work in conjunction with dumps made by [this](https://github.com/Gamers-Against-Weed/mvs-dump) tool.

Keep in mind that this does not work very well because it was not made with functioning members of society in mind. I also did not make it autoupdate so it may quickly become useless.

The thing is available on **GitHub Pages**: https://awuctl.github.io/mvs

## Searching tip

If you want to look for ("Windows 10") and not ("Windows" and "10"), use "+" instead of a space ("Windows+10").
